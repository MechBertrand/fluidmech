    "__FM -__ Fluid Mechanics  \n",
    "__TM -__ Thermodynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__ $\\doteq$ -__ Used to indicate the dimensions of a secondary quantity in terms of a primary quantity i.e. Velocity in terms of lengh per time ${[V]}\\doteq \\frac{{[L]}}{[T]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "[//]: # (My additions below are italicized and I striked out the portion I disagreed with. Let's get clarification!)\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Absolute Pressure -__ Denoted (abs) pressure relative to absolute zero pressure (perfect vaccuum)\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Bingham Plastic -__ Neither solid nor fluid. Can withstand finite, non-zero shear stress without motion (so not a fluid), once yield stress is exceeded, will flow like a fluid. (think toothpaste)\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Bulk Modulus (of Elasticity) ($E_v$)-__ Measurement of compressibility. $E_v = -\\frac{dp}{\\frac{d\\veebar}{\\veebar}} = \\frac{dp}{\\frac{d\\rho}{\\rho}} $ dimensions of pressure $\\frac{[F]}{[L]^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Cavitation -__ The formation and subsequent collapse of vapor bubbles in a flowing fluid. In flowing fluids it is possible to develop very low pressure due to fluid motion. If the pressure drops to or below the __vapor pressure__ boiling will occur. If the vapor bubbles thus formed swept into a region of higher pressure they can suddenly collapse. This can happen with sufficent intensity to cause structural damage to a pump or or other such fluid system.\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Continuum -__ Modeling an object as a continuum assumes that the substance *has average properties though the volume which it fills. These properties include density, specific weight, specific gravity etc. Liquids and gases are both treated as continuous fluids.\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Density -__ Mass per unit volume ${[\\rho]}\\doteq \\frac{{[M]}}{[L]^3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Dynamic Viscosity ($\\mu$) -__ Constant of porportionality which relates __shear stess ($\\tau$)__ with the __velocity gradiant ($\\frac{du}{dy}$)__. dimensions are given in $\\frac{[F][t]}{[L]^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Fluid -__ A substance that __deforms continuously__ when acted on by a __shearing stress__ of any magnitude. Properties of a fluid include:\n",
    "  * Needs a container\n",
    "  * Takes the shape of the container\n",
    "  * Sustains compression and tension\n",
    "  * Cohesive forces cause fluid molecules to form a surface which is always horizontal\n",
    "  \n",
    "__ Gage Pressure -__ Pressure measured relative to local atmospheric pressure. Absolute pressure can be obtained by adding the atmospheric pressure to the gage pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Isentropic -__ A process in which there is no heat exchanged with the surroundings. For gas expansion the relationship between pressure and density is $\\frac{p}{\\rho ^k}=$ a constant, where $k $ is the rato of the specific heat at a constant pressure ($C_p$) to the heat at a constant volume ($C_\\veebar$) so $k=\\frac{C_p}{C_\\veebar} $\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Isothermal -__ A process under constant temperature conditions. For gas expansion the relationship between pressure and density is $\\frac{p}{\\rho}=$ a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Kinetic Viscosity ($\\nu$)-__ $\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}$ the ration between the __Dynamic Viscosity__ and the __Density__ of a fluid. This is the governing portion of the __Reynolds number__ dimensions $\\frac{{[L]^2}}{[t]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Newtonian Fluid -__ Fluids for which the shearing stress is linearly related to the rate of shearing strain (aka the rate of angular deformation $\\frac{\\delta \\beta}{\\delta t}$).\n",
    " - _Shear thinning fluids:_ apparent viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate. More shear $\\rightarrow$ less viscosity (easier flow)\n",
    " - _Shear thickening fluids:_ apparent viscosity increses with increasing shear rate. More shear $\\rightarrow$ more viscosity (harder flow)\n",
    " \n",
    "__Mach Number ($Ma$) -__ The ratio between velocity and the speed of sound in a liquid. if $Ma < 1.0$ speed is subsonic, if $Ma > 1.0$ speed is supersonic. This is a dimensionless parameter. Speed of sound increases with increasing temperature $\\therefore$ Mach number decreases as temp increases. \n",
    "\n",
    "__ Pressure -__ Normal force per unit area ${[p]}\\doteq \\frac{{[F]}}{[L]^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Reynolds Number ($Re $)__ $\\frac{\\rho VD}{\\mu}$ A dimensionless number used in fluid mechanics to indicate whether fluid flow past a body or in a duct is steady or turbulent.  Where V is mean fluid velocity, D is diameter of pipe. The ratio $\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}$ is the important piece of the Reynolds number See __Kinematic Viscosity__. \n",
    "\n",
    "__ Shearing Stress ($\\tau$) -__ Tangential force acting on a surface, units given in force per unit area $\\frac{[F]}{[A]^2}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "__ Speed of Sound -__ The velocity at which small disturbances propogate (pressure waves) through a fluid. Related to changes in pressure and density of fluid medium through eq: $c = \\sqrt{\\frac{dp}{d\\rho}}$ and in terms of bulk modulus by $c = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_v}{d\\rho}}$ *($\\leftarrow$ can be used with liquids)*. If disturbance is small, heat transfer is negligible (__isentropic__). $\\therefore c = \\sqrt{\\frac{kp}{\\rho}}$ Using ideal gas law $c = \\sqrt{kRT}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "__ Specific Gravity ($SG$)-__ The ratio of the density of a fluid to the density of water at a specified temperature. ${[SG]}\\doteq \\frac{{[\\rho]}}{[\\rho]_{H2O}}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "__ Specific Volume ($\\upsilon$) -__ Volume per unit mass, the reciprocal of __Density__ $\\therefore$ ${[\\upsilon]}\\doteq \\frac{{[L]^3}}{[M]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Specific Weight ($\\gamma$) -__ Weight per unit volume, related to __Density__ through ${[\\gamma]}\\doteq [\\rho] [g]$\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Surface Tension ($\\sigma$-__ The intensity of the molecular attraction per unit length along any line in the free surface of a fluid. dimensions $\\frac{[F]}{[L]}$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Transient Motion -__ An oscillatory or other irregular motion occurring while a quantity is changing to a new steady-state value.\n",
    "\n",
    "__ Vapor Pressure ($p_v$) -__  The pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases (solid or liquid) at a given temperature in a closed system. The equilibrium vapor pressure is an indication of a liquid's evaporation rate. *A liquid boils when the absolute pressure becomes equal to the vapor pressure* \n",
    "\n",
    "__ Velosity Gradiant ($\\frac{du}{dy}$) -__ A relationship between the speed of flow relative to distance from a surface in no slip conditions. In more complex situations this relationship is not linear.\n",
